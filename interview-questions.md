# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.


1. What is `this` in JavaScript?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer: The 'this' keyword refers to an object. The object that it refers to depends on which object is being called. It's usually used with a period after it then the name of the object. - Omar B

  'This' keyword is used most often inside of a class to describe the object the class will instantiate into. I have used 'This' often in React class components.



2. What is React? Why would you use it?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer: 
    React is a library/collection of code snippets that allows developers to more easily create dynamic single page websites or applications.  
    Developers are able to use JSX syntax which combines the structure of a normal html file with the code and behavior of a JS file all into one. 
    Using React allows for simpler oversight of the `View`(MVC) aspect of an application. It creates a dynamic environment where data can be exchanged
    and manipulated without having to reload the page. It is scalable , flexible and efficient when used to separate, update and render all 
    of ones various components. - Jacob V



3. Which lifecycle method is required in a React class component?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer: The only required lifecycle method in a React class component is 'render.' Render is in charge of displaying JSX as HTML ona  page. 
  When I created my first React Class component ... 
  When I was getting some tutoring in React, I played around with the render and invoking different pieces of code using it.




4. What is JSX? What is one notable difference between HTML and JSX?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer: 'JavaScript XML' JSX and HTML are different in that JSX is a place where the display functionality of HTML and the logical capabilities of JavaScript meet. JSX allows you to code HTML syntax and JavaScript code inside the same component. XML is the extension of HTML called XHTML. 



5. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run yarn?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer: Yet Another Resource Negotiator. Yarn is a package Manager for JavaScript. Made by Facebook, as a replacement for NPM to improve on loading times for the packages. Yarn was released in 2016. To utilize yarn use the command '$ yarn...' in your terminal with a following command. node_modules, package.json and the yarn.lock.



6. STRETCH: What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer: An anonymous function in JavaScript is when you create a function in JavaScript that is not associated with any name. When you operate on an array with the .map you pass the map an argument of ()=>{} with value as on of the anonymous functions parameters 

  .map()
  .map(()=>{})
  .map((value, index)=>{
    return value + index
  })
  .map(value => value.toUpperCase())


() => {}  w/o 'const functionName ='

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

3. JavaScript Events: Occurs when the page loads or is manipulated, by the browser or the user interacting with HTML. 

4. Object-oriented programming: A computer programming model that organizes software around objects (data and methods) rather than around functions and logic. 

5. Ruby: A dynamic Programming language that focuses on simplicity and productivity.
